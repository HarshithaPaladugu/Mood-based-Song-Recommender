#  Mood-Based Song Recommender using LLM and YouTube API

This is a Streamlit-based application that recommends songs from YouTube based on the **user’s emotional state**, detected from a journal-style input. It combines the power of a local **Large Language Model (LLM)** (e.g., `gemma3:1b` via [Ollama](https://ollama.com)) with the **YouTube Data API** to deliver personalized music suggestions across multiple Indian languages.

##  Workflow Overview

1.  User Input (Journal Entry):
   - The user types a short sentence about how they’re feeling.
   - Example: _"I feel anxious about tomorrow's interview."_  

2. ** Language Selection:**
   - The user selects a preferred language (e.g., Hindi, Tamil, English).

3. Mood Detection (LLM via Ollama):
   - The text input is sent as a prompt to a local LLM (e.g., `gemma3:1b`).
   - The model returns a detected mood: `happy`, `sad`, `angry`, `chill`, `romantic`, `anxious`, or `spiritual`.

4.  YouTube Music Search:
   - Using the detected mood and selected language, a YouTube search query is formed:
     ```
     "{mood} mood {language} music"
     ```
   - Example: `"romantic mood Telugu music"`

5.  Song Recommendation:
   - The YouTube Data API fetches top 3 matching videos.
   - Each song includes:
     - Title
     - Thumbnail preview
     - Link to play on YouTube

6.  Streamlit Output:
   - The app displays the mood, thumbnails, song titles, and clickable links in a clean UI.
